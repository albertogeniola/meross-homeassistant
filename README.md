# Meross HomeAssistant component
A full-featured Homeassistant component to drive Meross devices. 
This component is based on the underlying MerossIot library available [here](https://github.com/albertogeniola/MerossIot).

## Version 1.0 is here!
After months of work and sleepless weekends, it's finally time to present to the Meross community the new version of the 
HomeAssistant component that allows Meross device controlling. The new version of this library is based on the 
complete refactored low-level MerossIot library. It's now fully async, based on Meross push notifications and 
much more robust and resilient to network disconnections.

### Updating from legacy versions
In case you are updating the component from legacy versions, you need to remove the previous one and fully remove
cached devices/entities from your HomeAssistant installation. This is necessary as the library completely changed
the device/entity naming system and is unable to remove previous entities installed by old versions of the component.
Sorry about that. 

## Towards Homeassistant official integration
My personal goal is to make this component fully compliant with Homeassistant, so 
that it may be added as the official library to handle Meross devices. 
However, before pushing a PullRequest to the official Homeassistant repository, I would like to share with to some users.
In this way we can test it massively, check it for any bug and make it **robust enough** to be seamlessly integrated 
with Homeassistant.

For now, the component has been integrated as a custom component into [HACS](https://custom-components.github.io/hacs/).

## Installation & configuration
You can install this component in two ways: via HACS or manually.
HACS is a nice community-maintained components manager, which allows you to install git-hub hosted components in a few clicks.
If you have already HACS installed on your HomeAssistant, it's better to go with that.
On the other hand, if you don't have HACS installed or if you don't plan to install it, then you can use manual installation.

### Option A: Installing via HACS
If you have HACS, well, it's a piece of cake! Just search for "Meross" (Full name is Meross Cloud IoT) in the default repository of HACS and it'll show up!
Click on Install: when done, proceed with component setup.

### Option B: Classic installation (custom_component)
1. Download the latest zip release archive from [here](https://github.com/albertogeniola/meross-homeassistant/releases/latest) (or clone the git master branch)
1. Unzip/copy the meross_cloud directory within the `custom_components` directory of your homeassistant installation.
The `custom_components` directory resides within your homeassistant configuration directory.
Usually, the configuration directory is within your home (`~/.homeassistant/`).
In other words, the configuration directory of homeassistant is where the config.yaml file is located.
After a correct installation, your configuration directory should look like the following.
    ```
    └── ...
    └── configuration.yaml
    └── secrects.yaml
    └── custom_components
        └── meross_cloud
            └── __init__.py
            └── common.py
            └── cover.py
            └── ...
    ```

    **Note**: if the custom_components directory does not exist, you need to create it.

### Component setup    
Once the component has been installed, you need to configure it in order to make it work.
To do so, simply add a new "integration" and look for Meross among the proposed ones.
The following animation shows how to do that.

## Features
### Massive support
This library supports all the Meross devices currently exposed by the Meross IoT library.
In particular Bulbs, Switches, Garage Door Openers and Smart Valves/Thermostat are fully supported and perfectly integrated with HomeAssistant.

### Efficiency and adoption of Homeassistant best practices
Since I'm aiming at making this component part of the official HA repo, I've put a lot of effort into following 
HomeAssistant best practices, in particular:
- Asynchronous functions when possible;
- No polling: the library is event-based. It saves bandwidth and makes the UI much more reactive.
- Robust to disconnection: the library handles network disruption;
- Lovelace notification: supports UI persistent event notification;
- PEP8 code styling
